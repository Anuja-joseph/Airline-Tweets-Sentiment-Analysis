# Airline-Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis
#I have taken data of US Airline tweets and their sentiments from Kaggle. The task is to do sentiment analysis about the problems of each major U.S. airline to find out which airline provides better service and analyze the reasons behind the reviews so that they can offer quality service.
#Twitter data was scraped from February , 2015 and contributors were asked to classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets. This is a typical supervised learning task where we have to categorize the text strings into predefined categories.
